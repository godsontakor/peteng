    "## Smart water flooding analytical solution\n",
    "This document is mostly based on the SPE-7660 paper by Gary Pope. I first implement the simple water flooding analytical solution and then expand it to low salinity water flooding with and without ionic adsorption.\n",

    "## Mathematical model\n",
    "The two phase flow equation in a 1D porous medium reads\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial S_w}{\\partial t}+\\frac{u}{\\varphi}\\frac{df_w}{dS_w}\\frac{\\partial S_w}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n",
    "The velocity of a constant saturation front is calculated by\n",
    "$$V_{S_w} = (\\frac{dx}{dt})_{S_w}=\\frac{u}{\\varphi}\\frac{df_w}{dS_w}$$\n",
    "The shock front is specified by\n",

    "The injected water front velocity (i.e., a tracer in the injected water, or the low salinity of the injected brine) is calculated by\n",

    "an the water saturation that corresponds to the position of the salinity front is given by\n",
